Description: Set the bcftools plugin path to search system directories
 The tests were intended to be run at build time only, so the test
 script sets the plugins to be searched for /only/ in the build directory.
 It does so by setting the environment variable BCFTOOLS_PLUGINS. However,
 as described in the manpage bcftools(1), adding a colon to either side of
 the path entry in the environment variable also searches the system
 directories. We need this for autopkgtest to work.
