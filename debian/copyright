Comment:
         Dual-licensing is in effect for the default compilation mode.
         When linked with the GPL-licensed GNU Scientific Library
         (as is done for this Debian package), the
         resulting program must be distributed under the GPL.
         .
         The source distribution simply states "GPL-licensed" without indicating
         a version of the GPL, but includes a copy of GPL-3.
